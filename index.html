                Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.
                Briefly explain one challenge you experienced in setting up this site
                and how you overcame it.

                    I made my site with vanilla javaScript. Given the requirements
                    of the task I wanted to go with a lightweight option.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I encountered a minor challenge while adding a custom domain to my
                        website. I chose to experiment with configuring DNS records through
                        GoDaddy, opting out of Netlify's DNS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is suggested that I set www.customdomain.com as the primary
                        domain to benefit from the full advantages of a CDN. I
                        attempted to set the www subdomain as the primary while the status
                        was "Awaiting External DNS." Following the steps, Options (dropdown) &#8594 "Set as
                        primary domain" &#8594 a confirmation modal appears &#8594 "Set as primary
                        domain".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, after confirming, the modal updated with a warning: "We're
                        provisioning a certificate for your site, and you cannot change
                        custom domains until that process completes." Subsequent clicks on
                        'Set as primary domain' within the modal had no effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        
                        Deciphering the warning, it seemed that a background process was in
                        progress to facilitate my transaction. Despite waiting for some
                        time, I received no additional information. To investigate further,
                        I opened DevTools, examined the network tab, and when I analyzed the response, I discovered a 422 status
                        code along with the error/warning message present in the modal.
                        <code>
                            <pre>
                                {
                                    "code": 422,
                                    "message": "We're provisioning a certificate for your site, you cannot change custom domains until that process completes"
                                }
                            </pre>
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Believing that resolving the "Awaiting External DNS" status was
                        necessary, I followed the steps to clear it. Once the DNS records
                        were successfully recognized by Netlify, I could then set the
                        subdomain as my primary domain without any issues. Notably, this
                        occurred on the Chrome browser.
                    </p>

                        Possible Solution:

                            <li>
                                Disable the 'Set as primary domain' button while the 'Awaiting External DNS' status is present.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add additional information indicating that the DNS records must be set before attempting to set the www subdomain. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think are two major
                    challenges around DNS configuration for less-technical customers hosting
                    websites.

                    <p>
                        One primary challenge revolves around the comprehension of A (Address) and CNAME (Canonical Name) records. The A record serves the function of mapping a domain name to the IPv4 address of the web server hosting the website. While the CNAME records resolve alias names to their true or canonical domain names. Sifting through the documentation of the registrar to understand how to update the DNS records might also be an issue. Misconfiguration can bring down a website which could cause frustration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another significant challenge pertains to understanding Time to live (TTL) and its impact on DNS propagation. The TTL parameter dictates the duration for which DNS information is considered valid. Notably, some hosting providers implement prolonged TTLs, resulting in delays of several hours or even days for DNS updates to propagate. This may lead to customer frustration or a misconception of potential misconfigurations when anticipated updates are not promptly reflected.

        A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won't
        build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this
        error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero
        exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site's
        source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How
        would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also,
        please compose your best customer-facing first response.

                I would take the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Check to see that the issue has not been reported and resolved in the past. There might be detailed troubleshooting steps documented that I could reference to the customer. I would take note of that information to include in my response to the customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Check the documentation surrounding the build process to see if I could find any clues to the potential problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask my team and the development team for assistance since they might have a better understanding of the underlying issue or potential causes. They might also be able to confirm my findings to ensure I am on the right track.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try to trigger the same build error and take note of the different situations that cause it. Although I could not make an exhaustive list of all of the potential causes, this can help with documentation, knowledge sharing, and troubleshooting suggestions. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Craft a detailed response to the customer outlining troubleshooting steps that could be taken. I could also ask some qualifying questions to the customer before sending any troubleshooting steps as some might not be relevant to their current situation.

                    <li>
                         Gather all information during my investigation and document it thoroughly.

                    <li>Take note of any information listed in the report that can be tested quickly.</li>
                    <li>Notify my supervisor immediately of the report since security is a high priority, I would not want to waste valuable time addressing the issue on my own when it might need cross-functional cooperation. This might include bringing in IT, developers, and the legal department depending on the severity of the report.</li>
                    <li>Run any tests that I can perform avoiding anything that could potentially be a security risk.</li>
                    <li>Document all steps taken during the investigation as well as any findings.</li>
                    <li>Check logs if applicable and see if there have been similar reports indicating the same or similar issues and see how they've been resolved and gather as much information as possible.</li>
