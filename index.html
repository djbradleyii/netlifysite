        A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t
        build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this
        error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero
        exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s
        source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How
        would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also,
        please compose your best customer-facing first response.

        How would you set up an http 301 status redirect from
        “/netlify/anything” on your site, to
        https://www.google.com/search?q=anything. Please provide the redirect
        formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy
        redirect rule directly to your site.

        Please attempt to deploy a function on our service. This need not be
        complicated. It could be "Hello World". Note that failure to deploy is
        not failing the exercise! Whether you have trouble or not, please
        describe what you experienced and how you attempted to troubleshoot any
        issues you encountered.

        We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at
        this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react
        to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on
        www.netlify.com. You can't immediately confirm the report, so what steps
        might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you
        say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion
        yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned
        about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is
        correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you
        escalate?
