        Talk about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.
        Briefly explain one challenge you experienced in setting up this site
        and how you overcame it.

          Response: I made my site with Vanilla javaScript. Given the requirements
          of the task it is more efficient to go with a lightweight option. I
          did not encounter any challenges in setting up this site. Since I have
          a background in Software Engineering and a good understanding of git
          and github that step was pretty straightforward. Also, Netlify's one
          click deploy process makes everything extremely easy from that
          perspective.

          Response: As mentioned above, the one click deploy and the speed at
          which everything is available is impressive to me. The navigation is
          intuitive and I appreciate that there are links to documentation for
          each section of the dashboard that I visit.

            I encountered a challenge while integrating a custom domain into my
            website. I chose to experiment with configuring DNS records through
            GoDaddy, opting out of Netlify's DNS.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is suggested that I set the www.customdomain.com as the primary
            domain in order to benefit from the full advantages of a CDN. I
            attempted to set the www subdomain as the primary while the status
            was "Awaiting External DNS." Following the steps, Options (dropdown) &#8594 "Set as
            primary domain" &#8594 a confirmation modal appears &#8594 "Set as primary
            domain".
          </p>

          <p>
            However, after confirming, the modal updated with a warning: "We're
            provisioning a certificate for your site, and you cannot change
            custom domains until that process completes." Subsequent clicks on
            'Set as primary domain' within the modal had no effect.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interpreting the warning, it seemed that a background process was in
            progress to facilitate my transaction. Despite waiting for some
            time, I received no additional information. To investigate further,
            I opened DevTools, examined the network tab, and discovered a 422
            code along with the error/warning message present in the modal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Believing that resolving the "Awaiting External DNS" status was
            necessary, I followed the steps to clear it. Once the DNS records
            were successfully recognized by Netlify, I could then set the
            subdomain as my primary domain without any issues. Notably, this
            occurred on the Chrome browser.
          </p>

          <p>
            A suggested fix to this issue would be to disable the 'Set as
            primary domain' button while the 'Awaiting External DNS' status is
            present. Additionally, providing a clear indication to the user that
            external records must be set before attempting to set the www
            subdomain as the primary would enhance the user experience.

        A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won't
        build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this
        error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero
        exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site's
        source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How
        would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also,
        please compose your best customer-facing first response.

        We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at
        this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react
        to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on
        www.netlify.com. You can't immediately confirm the report, so what steps
        might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you
        say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion
        yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned
        about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is
        correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you
        escalate?
